## Setup your coding environment

First of all, you will need a script editor that supports **lua** scripting to be able to edit your scripts, personally I recommend using [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but you can also use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for example.

### Locate the **Scripts** folder

Once your favorite text editor is setup, you'll need to locate the **Scripts** folder. The **Scripts** folder is located inside the PolyPlaza directory, the PolyPlaza directory is located inside of the same folder as your PolyPlaza.exe file. You can use the steam feature "open local files" to locate it easily. Once you located the scripts folder, open it with your code editor.

### Directory structure

Inside of the Scripts folder you'll find a lot of lua files already here, they are used to make the base game work so be careful when you modify those. Also, please keep in mind that the default Scripts folder will **reset** each time you update your games trough steam, so I highly recommend you to keep your code safe in an other folder, like in my documents for example, and copy it inside of Scripts when you want to test.

### Create your first mod

To create your first mod, you just need to create a new folder inside of Scripts and the lua files inside will automatically be loaded when you start the game!
