# Introduction

This guide covers the UI-related functions available for Lua scripting in VGS games. These functions allow you to create custom UI elements and control the game's flow by quitting or resuming the game.

## Functions

### CreateUI()

**Description:**

Creates a new UI object that you can use to build and manage custom user interfaces within the game.

**Syntax:**

```lua
local ui = CreateUI()
```

**Returns:**

- `ui`: A `UI` object that provides methods to create UI elements like buttons, text fields, images, etc.

**Example:**

```lua
local ui = CreateUI()

-- Add a button to the UI
ui:AddButton("Click Me", function()
    print("Button was clicked!")
end)
```

### SendNotification(message)

**Description:**

Displays a notification message to the player.

**Syntax:**

```lua

```

**Parameters:**

- `message`: A string containing the notification text to display.

**Example:**

```lua
SendNotification("Welcome to the game!")
```

### Quit()

**Description:**

Exits the game application. This function is useful for creating exit buttons or handling game over scenarios.

**Syntax:**

```lua
local success = Quit()
```

**Returns:**

- `success`: A boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the quit operation was successfully initiated.

**Example:**

```lua
-- Quit the game when the player loses all lives
if playerLives <= 0 then
    local success = Quit()
    if success then
        print("Game is quitting...")
    else
        print("Failed to quit the game.")
    end
end
```

### Resume()

**Description:**

Resumes the game if it is paused. This function can be used to close pause menus or resume gameplay after a modal UI is dismissed.

**Syntax:**

```lua
local success = Resume()
```

**Returns:**

- `success`: A boolean value indicating whether the resume operation was successfully triggered.

**Example:**

```lua
-- Resume the game after closing a pause menu
local success = Resume()
if success then
    print("Game has been resumed.")
else
    print("Failed to resume the game.")
end
```
